# Welcome to the SARP Programming Website

[SARP](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/earthscience/programs/airbornescience/studentairborneresearchprogram) is a NASA-run reasearch intership for earth science undergraduates held in California, USA every summer. This website hosts content for the programming portion of the internship.

The contents of this site include:

* lessons - notebooks used in a lesson during the first two weeks, coding-intenstive part of the internship. Many lessons include practie problems and answers in that section below
* additional lectures - less formal notebooks accompanying more sporadic as-needed instruction throughout the summer
* practice sheets - notebooks with practice problems to accompany some of the lessons

Lessons are divided into two groups:
1. gridded data - data that fills a mesh represting data in space. These are often satellite images
2. tabular data - data with rows and columns; the type of data that would fit in an excel sheet
