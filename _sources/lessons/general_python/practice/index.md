# General Python Practice Sheets

This section contains notebooks which have practice problems for many (but not all) of the lessons. Practice sheets are notebooks that can be downloaded and worked on, and many practice sheets also have an answers notebooks as well.

The practice sheets have two parts. The first part is a good place to start if you are totally new to Python. The are a bit easier.  Folks with more coding experience may choose to skip to the second part, where the practice problems become a step harder.
