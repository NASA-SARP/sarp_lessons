The mostly commonly used ellisoid is the WGS 84 ellipsoid which was defined in 1984. In addition to defining the size of the ellipsoid we also need to define where the center of the ellipsoid should sit so that it is acurrate for as many places on earth at once.  Defining where to put the ellipsoid is called the **datum**.\n",
